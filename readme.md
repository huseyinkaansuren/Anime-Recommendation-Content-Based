# Anime Recommendation by Content


## Project Description
This project involves an anime prediction application that I developed using my data science skills.

I have developed an anime recommendation application using a content-based recommendation system and transformed it into a user-friendly interface using Streamlit. 
This project suggests anime based on subject of anime.



## Dataset
This dataset I created with web scraping from websites. In this dataset it has anime name, overview, studio name, genre, score, ranked, popularity, members.

| Column Names  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Name  | Name of anime  |
| Overview | Subject of anime  |

| Genre  | Main genre of anime |
| Score  | Average rating given by users (out of 10)  |
| Ranked  | Rank of anime in website |
| Members  | Number of user who added anime to their list |
